As computer scientists we have the duty to remember the basics of computer usage:
1) Change often your password
2) Don't use always the same password
3) Don't use passwords that are so weak when you know that computer scientists will use the same pc in a competition project
4) Use private repositories next time


### If your code is not working don't worry, we didn't change it, otherwise it would be working
